Just some of the topics:

* Science, Engineering, Mathematics
* Video games (PC)
* StarCraft
* Cars
* Programming
* Dara (my daughter)
* Deckard (my son)
* Music and Piano
* Home ownership and the try-to-DYI life
* Basketball (Celtics)
* Football and Fantasy Football (Patriots)

I will occasionally touch on more grim topics like politics and climate change 
but I would rather not dwell on such dolorous thoughts. As my interests grow and change,
I will likely discuss new topics or discuss certain topics more frequently. Don't like it? 
Leave. I am not as meme savvy as I once but I'll at least try to make this an enjoyable
read.
