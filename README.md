# Reminders for myself

I am creating this readme mostly as a reminder for myself on how to create a new post. Since I very infrequently write these posts, I always forget what steps are needed to do the local development and iteration. The actual deployment is straight-forward enough but hopefully these reminders will serve me well in the future.

If [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) is not installed, install it, you'll also need [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), and [gem](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)

1. `cd myz540.github.io`
2. `jekyll serve`
3. Create a new post by copy-pasting a previous post from `_posts` and updating the header information
