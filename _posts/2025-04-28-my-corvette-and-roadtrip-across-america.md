<h2> My Corvette </h2>

I mentioned in my last post that when I finished chemo, I would likely either get a dog or trade-in my Golf for a sports car. I spent many weeks cross-shopping C6 and C7 Corvettes with the Mustang GT and Camaro SS. There were pros and cons for all three options:

- All three have v8 engines (great)
- All three can come in manual transmission (great)
- Mustang has a crappier manual transmission but both Corvette and Camaro SS have amazing Tremec transmissions
- Corvettes were about 10k more expensive for similar year/mileage
- Mustang and Camaro give off "just home from my first military deployment" energy
- Corvette gives off "divorced 50's dad" energy
- Corvette has 2 seats while Mustang and Camaro have 4

Ultimately, I landed on a 2015 z51 7MT Corvette... the only issue is it was located in Las Vegas, NV.

<h3> Exotic Car Trader </h3>

I first discovered the car on AutoTrader but the car was listed incorrectly. The car was listed as a base 2015 Stingray with ~50k miles, but reading the description and CarFax, it became clear the car had the z51 performance package and was worth a bit more than a base Stingray. As a result, the list price of 38k seemed like quite the bargain.

The car was offered by a private seller through [Exotic Car Trader][exotic-car-trader]

Admittedly, I was initially concerned this was all a scam but I did some research and the company seemed legit.

Their process is simple:

1. Negotiate price
2. Agree on price and sign sales contract
3. Wire money to escrow account managed by ECT
4. Once funds clear, ECT works to get the title in hand
5. ECT offered to ship the car to me for 2.4k but I figured I could do it cheaper by flying out and driving it back
6. ECT got me a temporary registration in Florida and some temporary plates
7. Once I've taken delivery, ECT works to assign me the title and mail it to me
8. I then take the title, sales contract, and whatever insurance info I have and go register the car proper

I am currently at step 6 with the car in my driveway and am waiting on the title. They should also send me an affidavit stating that I paid the 6% FL sales tax and any MA tax I owe will be the difference.
