<h2> It's been a long time... </h2>

It's been a long time, I shouldntve left you... without a dope beat to step to. But no really, it has been a long time. In fact, I didn't publish a single blog post in 2021, which is absolutely crazy since that was essentially a full year of COVID where I was working from home and had plenty of time and substance to write about. Alas, I've been busy. The most important update is of course the birth of my son, Deckard Sen Zhong.

As of this writing, the boy is now 6 months old and we have just spent the last month visiting my parents in California. They also came to visit us over the summer when he was first born and frankly, I don't know how we would've managed taking care of him and Dara without their help. One of the greatest delusions of our modern time is that a couple can raise a child on their own. What kind of nonsensical expectation is that... I was essentially raised by my grandparents and aunts and uncles until the age of 4. We all lived under the same roof, ate meals at the same table, and as a result, I was never lacking for attention or care. My parents were young and working so it was unreasonable to expect them to raise me alone, yet that seems to be almost the norm these days, disappointing as it may be. Personally, I think children should be raised in the presence of as much as family as possible. Whoever said "It takes a village..." surely knew what they were talking about.

Even now, as we prepare to return to Massachusetts and continue our work-from-home lifestyle, we still have not found a daycare opening for Deckard and we will continue to have to juggle childcare with our fulltime jobs. Thankfully, we're fortunate to work for organizations that understand this challenge and are flexible in that regard.

I'll attempt to recount my experience thus far of raising my second child but given my limited time and sleep-deprived memory, this will truly be a "best-effort" type of post. It's no mystery that having sons is very important in Chinese culture. This is in fact true of many cultures but I never quite understood it, after all, raising me was certainly no picnic and just thinking about all the mind-numbingly stupid things I did growing up and how close I came to maiming and seriously injuring myself multiple times makes me nervous about having to contend with a boy of similar spirit. Deckard was born small, my wife is small so her uterus is small, and thus, by American standards, our children came out small.
